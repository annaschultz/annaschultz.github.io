I study the political economy of development and the politics of identity. 
My current research explores how ethnic and national identities are affected by technology, statebuilding, violence, and economic crisis. A second strand of research explores the implications of traditional leader strength for political accountability and local public goods provision in sub-Saharan Africa.  My work leverages an array of methodological approaches, including natural experiments, geographic regression discontinuity designs, and surveys and archival data collection in the field. I received my PhD in political science from Duke University, and have worked at the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University, and as a consultant.
