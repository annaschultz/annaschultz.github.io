I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Program on Identity and Conflict at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my PhD in political science from Duke University in 2017.


I study the political economy of development and the politics of identity. 
My current research explores the implications of traditional leader strength for political accountability and local public goods provision in sub-Saharan Africa. A second strand of research explores how ethnic and national identities are affected by technology, statebuilding, violence, and economic crisis. My work leverages an array of methodological approaches, including natural experiments, geographic regression discontinuity designs, and surveys and archival data collection in the field.
