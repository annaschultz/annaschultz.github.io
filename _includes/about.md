I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Program on Identity and Conflict at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my PhD in political science from Duke University in 2017.

I study the political economy of state building and informal politics in developing countries.
My current research explores the implications of traditional leader strength for political accountability and local public goods provision in sub-Saharan Africa. A second strand of research explores how violence and economic hardship influence ethnic identity. I am also interested in civil conflict, repression, and political methodology. My work incorporates household surveys, field experiments, formal modeling and spatial statistics.
